				These are drawings and paintings based on DND games.
				I included these here to share the themes and inspire new campaigns.
				Dungeons and Dragons can be any genre and setting but these medieval fantasy images can still provide a good base.

				This is a water color drawing of a palladin gnome DND player character.
				The gnome, named baylo, was born in a farm that was burnt down by bandits when he was six years old.
				After his home was reduced to particles in the air, Baylo traveled to the church where he found new shelter and support.
				At the church Baylo became a low level paladin but after only a few years he left to explore the rest of the world.
				Baylo used his musical talents to find lodging in Inns by proiding entertainment for money.
				Baylo meets the adventuring party eventually ends up traveling with in one of these Inns.

				This enemy boss group is a family based off of a famous scottish cannibal family.
				The head of the family, Bawney Sean, is directly named after the real life head of the family, Sawney Bean.
				Sawney Bean would live in a cave with his wife and his inbred children.
				When travelers passed by the area in which they lived, the entire Bean family would ambush them.
				The travelers would be easily killed and their remains would be stored in jars so that they could be eaten later on.
				Since no one passing by the cave would live to tell the tale, the Bean family grew and continued in their disgusting lifestyle for many years.

				This drawing is a group shot of the DND adventuring party of the DND podcast <strong>Not Another DND Podcast</strong> (NADDPOD).
				NADDPOD is a podcast where former College Humor cast members play Dungeons and Dragons in episodes.
				There are now more than 100 episodes.
				The characters I drew are the halflings Beverly and Balnor, crick elf Moonshine, and Human Hardwon.
				The two main antagonists of the original main campaign is a human who became a god, and a lich who became the ruler of the underworld.

				This is a character sketch of the NPC Roberto from the first campaign that I ran. 
				Roberto is a rich patron of the adventuring party.
				He actually paid the party to find out why people were getting lost around where Bawney Sean's cave (Bawney Sean is in one of the drawings earlier).
				The party discovered the cave and that Bawney Sean was behind the murders but sadly the combat encounter never finished.
				Since the group never met again the party never gave their services to Roberto despite being paid.
				Roberto will never be seen again...

				This is the chronologicaly first full page dnd drawing that I have done. 
				Its not very good but I do like the composition of the page.
				The three layers of depth look good no matter how welly detailed, outlined, and coloured it is.
				The situation in the game had a pack of wolves attack the player's house.
				All of the other characters were too injured to fight so the younger sister NPC of the player had to defend them all. 
				The game system I was using at the time had no rules on throwing knives so I made them myself and they were accidentally way overpowered.
				I didn't notice how broken they were at the time but thinking back now I would never use those made up rules again.

				This character named Fergus is an NPC mosty just used for carying the bags of the adventuring party. 
				I planned out his backstory as a prince who was stolen from his home and placed in an orphanage.
				In the orphanage the Fergus was picked on for being physically weak and small.
				He escaped the orphanage and that is how he met the party.
				Fergus's royal blood was never revealed to any of the players.
				One of the hints over royalty I incorperated into Fergus's character is that he kept a necklace from birth of the royal emblem.
				There was no story line planned around this hidden detail but I inclduded it to enrich the story.

				This is a watercolour drawing a magic necklace.
				The necklace was meant to be found in Bawney Sean's cave (an NPC  in an earlier drawing.)
				I planned that the necklace would find its way into the cave from a hired soilder he came to the cave to get rid of the cannibals that lived there.
				The necklace made the wearer invisible so the soilder was plotting wearing it, entering the cave and then taking the cannibals out before the could attack.
				I decided that the soilder would have been recklessly walking up to the cave without the necklace on and then had been anbushed by one of the canniblas.
				Sadly the necklace and the backstory was never revealed to the players becase the group stopped meeting.

				This is a rough drawing of a loved NPC in one of my campaigns.
				His nickname, created by the players is "Apple Guy."
				This is because while narrating the story I stopped halfway thtough a guard's dialogue to take a bite out of a sandwich.
				Everyone laughed and joked that that guard was also eating something and it was decided to be an apple.
				After the session I created that guard as a NPC.
				I gave him a magic glove that regenerated biotic life.
				I used that to explain why he would always be eating an apple when he would meet the players.
				He was always eating THE SAME apple.

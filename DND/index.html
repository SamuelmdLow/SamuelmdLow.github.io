			<p>
				Dungeons and Dragons (DND) is a <strong>table top roleplaying game</strong>.
				This means that the game is played by taking the role of a character and playing as it with atleast one other person.
				In DND there are atleast one but usally around four players and a dungeon master.
				The <strong>dungeon master (DM)</strong> is the person who runs the game.
				Most DND games consist of a campaigns, which in itself has several sessions.
				A session is when the players and the DM meet together to play.
				A campaign is a series of sessions that start with acquiring a large objective and ends with completing the goal or failing.
				The typical setting of a DND game is a <strong>medieval fantasy world</strong>.
				Players can interact with this world however they want (within the bounds of their character) and can even enter combat with <strong>non player characters (NPCs)</strong>.

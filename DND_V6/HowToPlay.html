			<p>
				DND is played using <strong>many types die</strong> along with <strong>roleplaying</strong>.
				The most common die used in DND is the twenty sided die which is in the shape of a dodecahedron.
				Dice are used for actions like attacking, running, investigating, reacting, preforming, presuading, deciving, etc.
				Roleplaying is used for players to get into their character and learn more about the world.
				Players talk to each other in character but also to the DM.
				The <strong>DM</strong> acts not only as the <strong>story teller</strong> who explains the settings and situations, but acts as all the NPCs.
				This would include enemies, allies, and patrons.
				Using a combination of <strong>dice rolls and roleplaying</strong> DMs give the experience of going on mythical adventures all while sitting at the couch!
